Bug List
---------------------------
getLastNum()

1) If minus precedes a negative number, the current negative number is not returned correctly.

Verified issue does not occur for other operators (+*/).

To reproduce:
3-1	> hit +/-
3-(-1)	> getLastNum runs
1)	> bug - should be (-1)

*Fixed 2/21*
Added logic to check for minus before negative number and change .substr() target accordingly.
---------------------------
flipSign()

1) If the padded zero (dot) is made negative and then made positive, 

Verified issue occurs regardless of preceding operator.
Verified issue does not occur if number is a zero-leading float (i.e. 0.1).

To reproduce:
3-	> hit .
3-0.	> hit +/- * this should not be legal *
3-(0)	> hit +/-
(0	> bug

* Fixed 2/21
Added logic to check last character in expression to see if it is a dot.
---------------------------
input()

1) Able to start an expression with an operator
2) Able to input concurrent operators.
3) Unable to input operator after a negative (due to blocking numbers directly after negative).

To reproduce issues 1 & 2: 
Hit any operator multiple times before or after entering a number.

To reproduce issue 3:
3	> hit +/-
(-3)	> hit an operator (+-*/)
(-3)	> bug

* Fixed 2/21
1) Broke number and operator handling into separate functions.
2) Added logic to operator() to check for empty expression and if last character is an operator.
