getLastNum()

If minus precedes a negative number, the current negative number is not returned correctly.

Verified issue does not occur for other operators (+*/).

To reproduce:

3-1	> hit +/-
3-(-1)	> getLastNum runs
1)	> bug - should be (-1)

*Fixed 2/21*
Added logic to check for minus before negative number and change .substr() target accordingly.

(0	> bug

* Fixed 2/21
Added logic to check last character in expression to see if it is a dot.
